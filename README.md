# Cloud Data Store Uploader

This is a basic environment for interacting with Cloud Datastore from a local
workstation. It builds on [the Cloud Datastore Node Client
tutorial](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/datastore/latest/) provided by Google
and exists almost solely so that the team can upload json files exported from
the already existing MongoDB to the Datastore.
